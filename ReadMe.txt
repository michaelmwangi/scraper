Language used: python 2.7
Command to run the code: python main.py 
Command to run the tests: python scraper_test.py

Notes:

I used a serial execution approach as it matched the instructions whereby we analyze each link after the other. 
If that was not the case I would have used an async event loop to make it more efficient.
